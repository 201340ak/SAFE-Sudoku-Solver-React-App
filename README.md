# SAFE-Sudoku-Solver-React-App
A Sudoku Solver using SAFE Stack, F#, and React

## Using SAFE-Stack

This application used the DotNet SAFE Template: 
* https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/#template-options
* https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/#create-your-first-safe-app

Copied code from this blog to add the logic that solves the Sudoku Puzzle:
 * http://www.navision-blog.de/blog/2016/08/14/fable-sudoku-creating-a-sudoku-solver-app-with-f/
 * https://github.com/forki/react-sudoku

To run use "./build.cmd run". That should install all the dependencies, and open up an instance of the application in your browser.
